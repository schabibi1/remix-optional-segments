# Remix Optional Segments Example
This is an example of how to use the optional segments feature of Remix.
As this example focuses on the Optional Segments feature, it doesn't have further features from Remix Tutorial, ["Data Mutations"](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/tutorial#data-mutations) section and the rest of the tutorial features.

# How it should work
- Select ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ on the UI â†’ You'll see localized names in Japanese with `ja` slug in the URL
- Select ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on the UI â†’ You'll see default language names in English without default language slug in the URL

# How to test it locally
1. Fork and clone the repo
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000/contacts` in your browser

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to change localized data (names, etc), you can find them in `app/data.ts`.
